# Playing the game
1. Make the terminal full screen
2. type "make build" in to the command line

The game will print a new board to the command line whenever a player 
takes a new action. 

Follow the prompts. Here are the main commands:

- "roll": rolls for the player and moves them n forward spaces where
      n is the number they rolled. 

- "roll n": Like command role except the amount of the roll can be specified.
      Example: "roll 10". We included this in order to make play testing easier
      for the grader (so that they can produce certain scenarios more easily).
      Do not pass in 0 or a negative number as this violates a precondition
      for the roll phase. 

- "buy": buys the current property the player is standing on.

- "pass": passes on purchasing the current property the player is on. Triggers 
      an auction.

- "buy [1-5] house/houses on [prop name]": buys specified number of houses on
      the property specified if possible.

- "sell [1-5] house/houses on [prop name]": sells the specified number of houses
      on the property specified if possible.

- "mortgage [prop name]": mortgages the property specified if possible

- "unmortgage [prop name]": unmortgages the property specified if possible

- "end turn": used to end the current player's turn during their final phase

- "pay": use when the player lands on a tax property or on another player's
      property to pay the required tax, rent, or jail fine.

- "check properties": use to check the current player's owned properties.

- "check money": use to check the current player's money balance.

- "declare bankruptcy": Can be used to retire the current player from the game.
      Typically used when player does not have enough money/assets to 
      pay a required amount/continue playing the game. Must be on landing pay.

- "trade with [player name]": initiates a trade offer to the player specified.
      Triggers the trading phase.

- "trade [property name|$amt] for [property name|$amt]": Command to complete a
      trade. Specify the property name(s) or cash amount. Make sure the cash
      has a "$" before the amount (example: $100). Trading a property for a 
      property or cash for a property is allowed but trading cash for cash is 
      not allowed.

- "cancel": exits trade phase without doing a trade.
